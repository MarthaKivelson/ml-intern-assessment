TOML (Tom’s Obvious, Minimal Language): It’s a simple configuration file format (like JSON or YAML) but is easier to read and write. 
TOML is becoming the standard for Python packaging metadata.

2. Why pyproject.toml is important:

> It was introduced with PEP 518 to modernize Python package building. Previously, everything was done using setup.py 
  but now pyproject.toml allows for more flexibility, better dependency management, and cleaner project configuration.
> It centralizes metadata about the project: project name, version, dependencies, authors, etc.
> It supports various build systems (like setuptools, poetry, etc.).

3. Explaining sections of pyproject.toml:

[project]: Defines the basic project information (name, version, description, authors).
[tool.setuptools]: Specifies that setuptools is being used to build the project.
[tool.setuptools.dynamic]: Links the external files (like requirements.txt) to dynamically pull dependencies.

4. setup.py with the advent of pyproject.toml: Some tasks previously handled by setup.py (like metadata) are now managed 
   by pyproject.toml. However, setup.py can still be used, especially if you have complex build steps.

5. How do setup.py, pyproject.toml, and requirements.txt work together?

> pyproject.toml: It’s now the central place for project metadata. Instead of defining your dependencies and project 
  information in setup.py, you can define them in pyproject.toml.
  As we did in your project, the line [tool.setuptools.dynamic] dependencies = {file = "requirements.txt"} links your requirements.txt 
  file to the TOML file, so when the project is built, the dependencies are fetched from requirements.txt.

> setup.py: While it’s still used for custom builds and configurations, most of the basic functionality (like metadata and dependencies) 
  is being transferred to pyproject.toml. You might still keep a minimal setup.py if you have custom build steps, but for many projects, 
  it’s not necessary anymore with pyproject.toml.

> requirements.txt: It lists all project dependencies and their versions.

When you run pip install -r requirements.txt, it ensures that all dependencies are installed. The pyproject.toml file can reference 
it (as we did) so that package dependencies are automatically pulled from there.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

Original: Allow all origins for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Configure middleware to handle CORS, allowing requests 
from any origin.

Simplified: When you load a web app (e.g., from http://localhost:3000) and it tries to access a server (e.g., http://localhost:8000), 
CORS controls whether the browser allows this connection. By default, browsers block requests from one 
"origin" (like a domain or port) to another for security reasons.

In this code, allow_origins=["*"] is set, which means allow all origins (any domain or app can connect). The middleware 
is added so that your FastAPI app accepts requests from any origin, making it easier for you to access the API from anywhere, 
such as different frontend apps.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Original:** > async

Simplified: `async` (short for *asynchronous*) allows your code to run tasks without waiting for each to finish one by one. 

For example, imagine you request some data from a user form on a website. While waiting for the data to be sent back, instead 
of sitting idle, the app can do other tasks (like handling another user's request) in the meantime.

Using `async` helps the app handle multiple requests faster and more efficiently, especially for tasks like reading form data, 
accessing databases, or making network requests.'''
